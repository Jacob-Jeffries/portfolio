# Personal Portfolio - In ReactJS

## Description 
This is a dynamic page generated using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Unlike the earlier portfolio page I created, this one renders different content on the page without reloading and has a Reactjs form with email validation. 

## Installation
This is a delpoyed site and does not require installation. You can visit the site on GitHub Pages:

https://jacob-jeffries.github.io/portfolio/

## Usage
This is a simple ReactJS web application with a few navigation links at the top, click each link to load the relevent content on the page.
